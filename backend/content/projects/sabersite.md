# Sabersite

Sabersite is the personal platform of Saber Dhib and is designed as a full system, not a static portfolio. Sabersite combines content, architecture documentation, and AI-ready knowledge structures.

Sabersite is built to support a Retrieval-Augmented Generation assistant that answers questions using curated sources. Sabersite organizes content for ingestion, chunking, embedding, and citation in a vector database.

Sabersite reflects Saber Dhib’s system design approach by separating content, API services, and UI layers. Sabersite uses a modular architecture to keep content authoritative and easy to maintain.

Sabersite shows how a personal site can function as an AI knowledge base. Sabersite is designed for long-term evolution, with clear boundaries between knowledge, presentation, and AI capabilities.

Sabersite demonstrates the importance of traceable sources and accurate answers. Sabersite is meant to support answers that are grounded and citeable rather than speculative.
