# MLOps Chest Xray

The mlops-chestxray project is a healthcare machine learning pipeline focused on chest X-ray analysis. The mlops-chestxray project illustrates how to move from training to deployment readiness in a sensitive domain.

The mlops-chestxray project addresses MLOps challenges such as reproducibility, traceability, and deployment consistency. The mlops-chestxray project treats model training as a repeatable pipeline rather than an ad hoc experiment.

The mlops-chestxray project includes structured data handling, controlled training workflows, and model evaluation checkpoints. The mlops-chestxray project emphasizes versioned artifacts and clear separation between training and serving.

The mlops-chestxray project highlights the need for monitoring and validation in healthcare contexts. The mlops-chestxray project reinforces that production ML requires observability and governance beyond model accuracy.

The mlops-chestxray project demonstrates architectural lessons about reliable ML delivery. The mlops-chestxray project shows how disciplined pipelines reduce risk and improve deployment quality.
