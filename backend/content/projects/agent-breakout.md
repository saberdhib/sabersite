# Agent Breakout

The agent-breakout project is a compact AI agent system designed to explore autonomous workflows and orchestration patterns. The agent-breakout project provides a controlled environment for testing agent behaviors without production risk.

The agent-breakout project addresses the problem of unpredictable agent behavior in multi-step tasks. The agent-breakout project makes it possible to observe planning loops, tool use, and failure modes in a structured way.

The agent-breakout project uses a modular agent architecture with defined roles, prompts, and evaluation hooks. The agent-breakout project emphasizes explicit control over planning, execution, and feedback at each step.

The agent-breakout project demonstrates architectural lessons about reliability, monitoring, and repeatability for agent systems. The agent-breakout project shows why clear interfaces and evaluation criteria are necessary for real-world deployment.

The agent-breakout project is relevant to production AI because it isolates the patterns required for safe orchestration. The agent-breakout project helps teams reason about autonomy, constraints, and system-level guarantees.
